# CardSimulator
Simple playing cards simulator. Created as an introduction from the author to C#.

Simply get into the root directory (cd CardSimulator/) and, making sure you have .NET installed, execute 'dotnet run'.

Currently, all its work is done using the terminal. I plan in integrating it with a webpage in the future, as a means of studying some
other JavaScript framework.
